##  Overview

In today’s hyper-connected world, **staying focused** is one of the biggest challenges faced by students and professionals alike.  
The ability to concentrate deeply is influenced by multiple lifestyle and behavioral factors such as **sleep, screen time, stress, study duration, motivation, and exercise habits**.

This project leverages **Machine Learning (Ridge Regression)** to predict an individual’s **FocusScore (0–100)** —  
a measure of how effectively they can maintain attention and productivity throughout the day.

Unlike generic productivity trackers, **Guess My Focus** doesn’t just predict — it **explains**.  
It highlights *which habits most influence focus* and provides **personalized improvement suggestions** based on data-driven insights.
